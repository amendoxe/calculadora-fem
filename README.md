# calculadora FEM
This is a challenge proposed by the course of complete intro to web development from Front End Masters.


It is a calculator that really only works for integers, anyway I´m happy at how I was able to implement
a lot of the topics that were thaught in the course, I´m yet to review the solution by the instructor
from which surely I´ll lear more efficient ways to acomplish it, but I´ll probably replicate that one in a private repository
